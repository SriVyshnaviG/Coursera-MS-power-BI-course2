Business Case study: Coffee shop sales insights

The café operates as a charming coffee shop known for its warm ambiance, friendly staff, 
and delicious coffee. The café offers a wide array of beverages, from classic espressos to 
specialty lattes, as well as a selection of fresh pastries and sandwiches to cater to the 
diverse tastes of its patrons. The coffee shop has established a loyal customer base, and 
people enjoy spending time there to socialize, work, or simply relax with a great cup of coffee. 
However, as more coffee chains and independent shops have opened in the area, the café has found it 
increasingly difficult to stand out and attract new customers. The coffee market has become saturated, 
and the local competition is fierce. The café's owner, Taylor, has noticed a decline in foot traffic and sales, and she's concerned about the future of her beloved establishment.

Taylor has decided to take a data-driven approach to address her business challenges. She's hired a data analyst
to help her better understand the café's performance and uncover potential opportunities for growth. In this 
exercise, you'll need to apply the knowledge you’ve gained regarding the data analysis process and the best 
practices for each step, evaluating whether the data analyst has conducted a thorough and accurate data analysis
process.

Stages in data analysis – Evaluating an analysis process:
Stage 1: Data collection

The data analyst started the data analysis process by gathering data from various sources, such as point-of-sale (POS) systems, customer feedback forms, online reviews, social media, and website analytics. They aimed to gather information on sales trends, customer demographics, preferences, and behavioral patterns. This data could, for example, allow the analyst to extract insights about the most popular beverages and food items, peak hours, and seasonal fluctuations. 

Stage 2: Data organization and cleaning

After gathering the data from multiple sources, the data analyst carefully organized and cleaned the data in preparation for data analysis.

Stage 3: Data analysis

With clean datasets in hand, the data analyst began analyzing the data to uncover trends, patterns, and opportunities. The analyst aimed to identify the most profitable menu items, discovering the preferences of specific customer segments, and pinpointing the most effective marketing channels. They made use of statistical techniques to explore relationships between variables and gain valuable insights. 

Here is a sample of the data insights gained through data analysis:

Data type

Data insights

Customer data
The primary customer demographic in the area has changed, with the café serving only a small segment of the possible customer audience.
There is a demand for more plant-based milk options.
Sales data
Certain menu items are not selling well.
Plant-based milk options are limited and often out of stock.
There are patterns in the decline of sales, with sales dropping on weekdays and at various times of the day.
Competitor data
Certain menu items are being sold at significantly higher price points by competitors.
Competitors focus more on short waiting times and takeaway offers. They also have a stronger social media presence and offer electronic rewards systems.

Stage 4: Data visualization

The analyst then went on to create charts, graphs, and dashboards based on their findings from the data analysis. For example, they created a bar chart comparing the sales performance of different menu items.

Stage 5: Generating data-driven recommendations

Based on the analysis, the data analyst then developed actionable recommendations to help the café improve its performance. The recommendations were supported by the data insights they gathered and tailored to address the café's unique challenges and opportunities.

Stage 6: Implementing recommendations and monitoring results

After making data-driven recommendations and giving Taylor the final report, the data analyst left the process of implementation to Taylor and her team, concluding the data analysis process.

Evaluate the data analysis process 

Once you have read through the data analysis process undertaken by the data analyst for the café, answer the questions that follow to evaluate the process:

Data analysis process:
Data collection

The data analyst began the data analysis process by gathering data. What should data analysts do in preparation for data collection to ensure the effectiveness of the data analysis process?

Because collecting the right data is crucial to conducting a successful analysis, analysts should consult closely with stakeholders like Taylor to better understand their goals for the analysis. Before collecting data, analysts must determine what data they need to collect in order to conduct an analysis that is relevant to business needs.

Before proceeding with data analysis, the data analyst organized and cleaned the data. What is the purpose of this step in the data analysis process?

After gathering the data, you need to organize and clean it to ensure its accuracy and reliability. By doing so, you'll create a clean and organized dataset that is ready for analysis.

What are two common issues the data analyst may have encountered during the data organization and cleaning step?

Data organization and cleaning commonly involves removing duplicate entries, filling in missing values, and correcting any inconsistencies or errors in the data. 

Data analysis

List two data sources that the data analyst may have analyzed to generate the sample of insights.

Data sources may have included: sales data, such as the number of items sold and profits, social media data, such as demographics and advertising metrics, customer data, such as demographics, preferences, and feedback and reviews, and data related to operations, such as stock management and inventory levels.

Data visualization

What is the role of visualizations in the data analysis process?

To effectively communicate your findings, you need to create visually appealing and easy-to-understand charts, graphs, and dashboards that consider accessibility issues. These visualizations help stakeholders like Taylor and her team grasp key insights from the data, making it easier for them to understand the implications of an analysis.

The data analysts should be involved in continuing to collect and analyze data to track the impact of their recommendations and ensure that the café stays on the path to growth and success.

Why is the step of implementing recommendations and monitoring results important?

This step is crucial for determining the effectiveness of data-driven strategies and making any necessary adjustments based on real-world results. Data analysis is an ongoing process, and continuous improvement and innovation are key to long-term success.

Additional steps

An additional step is fostering a data-driven culture. How could the data analyst work with Taylor to promote a data-driven culture throughout the process? Why do you think this is important?
